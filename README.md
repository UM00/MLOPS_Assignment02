THe Assignment was about Airflow in which we were to write a Dag script 
To automate the process of Exctracting Transforming and Then using the DVC to store tha data and do its versioning
First and foremost we configure the Airflow using Docker to load its Docker image
Then running it on a container locally
Then we write our Dag scripts to automate the whole process
